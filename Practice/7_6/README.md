# Chapter 7 “Creating a game called "Save the Space Village."”
## Task:
1. Improve the game started on the module, add the following functionality:
    1. Adjust the parameters so that at least 10 cycles of attacks on a village can be played.
    2. Add a box that displays the number of enemies in the next raid.
    3. Add a parameter that shows how many turns from the start of the game the enemies will start appearing. For example, so that for the first 3 cycles there are always 0 enemies in the raid, and then they start to arrive and their number increases.
    4. Buttons are blocked if there is not enough grain to hire, respectively, you can not go into a grain minus.
    5. Finish the death screen: display the number of survived raids, the amount of grain produced, peasants and warriors or, for example, fallen warriors - at your discretion.
    6. Make a screen and a victory condition. Enter a variable under this condition: for example, hire 100 peasants or accumulate 500 units of grain.
    7. Make a pause button and screen.
    8. Make a mute button.
    9. Implement a short click sound when buttons are clicked.
    10. When harvesting, attacking enemies, spawning peasants and warriors, eating grain, appropriate sounds should be played, something like [the sounds in classic Age of Empires II](https://youtu.be/2oTUvjgvVWE?t=16).
    11. Free sounds and music can be found here:
