## Task:

1. Create a location using Unity primitives: cubes, placeholders, capsules, and spheres. You can recreate a known location or build your own from scratch.
2. Create several prefabs for frequent use: lampposts, house windows, balconies, doors, walls, fences, playground elements, cars, and so on.
3. Find location-appropriate assets in the Asset Store. Let ready-made assets be no more than 30% of the total number of objects in the location. Customize the lighting according to the time of day: day, evening, morning, night.
4. Create many light sources: from a campfire, lanterns, house windows or car headlights.
5. Take many screenshots, position the camera at different points and angles to show different interesting locations.
